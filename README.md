# Crypto Quote Service

[Note this project is very much a WIP]

CQS is a program written in C++ for obtaining live asset prices from a number of crypto currency exchanges using their web-socket APIs and storing it in a common format.
This stored data can then be used for back testing against or for training machine learning based models for purposes such as HFT.

## Supported Exchanges

In the fullness of time support is planed for the following exchanges:

* Binance
* Coinbase
* Kraken
* KuCoin
* Bitstamp
